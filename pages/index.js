          <h1>Six of One Furniture</h1>
          <p>Each furniture piece is made of Six of One’s unique modular system consisting of bases, joinery, and structure . All components are made out of wood and can be customized in form, color, and add-ons that we provide for additional comfort. We achieve maximum sustainability by minimizing our materials to wood and standard recyclable screws for structural support. This makes it easier to recycle, upgrade, or rebuild into other furniture, therefore expanding the lifecycle of the product.</p>

Functioning as a non-profit, we reinvest our money into communities that are without proper living conditions. Additionally, we encourage customers to take advantage of our Circular Customer Model, donating, rebuilding, or recycling their furniture to keep waste out of our landfills.</p>
